        <p>The human body is everything that makes up, well, you.  What decides and regulates the physical form and function of the human body is our genetic information, however, external environments and behaviours can alter the way our body’s look and how well they function, according to Human Growth and Developments.  </p><p>If we were to “break apart” the human body at the microscopic level, then the cell would constitute its most basic unit.</p><p>The average adult has somewhere between 30 – 40 trillion cells, and an estimated 242 billion new cells are produced every day. When a select group of cells with similar functions come together, it forms a tissue. Tissues cumulate into organs, group of organs form organ systems and eventually, a complete organism.

        <h3 style="color:chocolate"><i>Skeleton</i></h3>
        <p>The human body exhibits a variety of movements from walking and running to crawling, jumping and climbing. The framework that enables us to do all these activities is the skeleton. Humans have as much as 300 bones at birth. However, the bones start to fuse with age. At adulthood, the total number of bones is reduced to 206.</p>
        <h3 style="color:chocolate"><i>Muscles</i></h3>
        <p>Muscles are specialised tissues which assist the bones in locomotion. Muscles are attached to the bones through tendons. Movement of limbs happens due to the contraction and relaxation of the corresponding muscles present in that region. Joints help in the flexibility of bones, but a bone cannot be bent or stretched until a muscle acts on it. In other words, the muscles attached to that bone pulls it to the direction of movement.</p><p>Furthermore, most movement involves muscles that work as a pair. For example, when we bend our arm, muscles in that region contract, become shorter and stiffer and pull the bones to the direction of movement. For relaxation (stretching), muscles in the opposite direction have to pull the bones towards it.</p>

            •	Body functions are the physiological or psychological functions of body systems. Survival of the body depends on the body's maintaining or restoring homeostasis, a state of relative constancy, of its internal environment.<br><br>
            •	Human life process includes organization, metabolism, responsiveness, movements, reproduction, growth, differentiation, respiration, digestion, and excretion. All these processes work together, in fine-tuned balance, for the well-being of the individual and to maintain life.<br><br>
            •	Life depends on certain physical factors from the environment, which include water, oxygen, nutrients, heat, and pressure.<br><br>
