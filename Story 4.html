        <p>The soul is the spiritual essence of a person, which includes one's identity, personality, and memories that is believed
        to be able to survive physical death. In many religious and philosophical traditions, soul means an immaterial aspect or essence
        of a living being, which is generally applied to humans. Ātman is a Sanskrit word that means inner self or soul. In Hindu philosophy,
        especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism, Ātman is the first principle, the true self of an individual beyond identification
        with phenomena, the essence of an individual. </p>

        <p>The six orthodox schools of Hinduism believe that there is Ātman (self, essence)
        in every being. </p><p>In Hinduism and Jainism, a jiva (Sanskrit: जीव, jīva, alternative spelling jiwa; Hindi: जीव, jīv, alternative 
        spelling jeev) is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force. </p><p>We know that every human being is created with a 
        soul. Our soul and body together form a unique human being. Each human soul is individual and immortal, immediately created by God. 
        The soul does not die with the body; rather it is separated from the body at death. Our Christian hope is that our body and soul will
        be reunited in the final resurrection. </p><br><br><br>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(94, 185, 3)"><i>The Theology ....</i></h2>
        <p>The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created immediately by God at the moment of conception — it is not a creation of 
        the child’s parents. While the body is mortal, the soul does not die. The Catechism of the Catholic Church says this about the soul: 
        “It does not perish when it separates from the body at death, and it will be reunited with the body at the final Resurrection”.</p>
        <p>All of the sacraments help to feed our soul with the grace to live our lives in unity with God. This is especially true of the 
        Eucharist, Feingold said, which is the ultimate sacrament of charity, where we receive and are spiritually nourished by the Body and 
        Blood of Christ, who died for love of us.</p>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(94, 185, 3)"><i>The Philosophy ....</i></h2>
        <p>If we’re to understand more about the existence of the human soul, we must turn to philosophy for the answer, said Father Fadi Auro, 
        assistant professor of philosophy at Kenrick-Glennon Seminary.</p><p>“The human soul is not empirical or sensitively observed — it
        has to be reasoned to,” said Father Auro. “The proof of the soul and the immortality of the soul is properly a matter of philosophy, 
        not science.”</p><p>Philosophy conclusively proves that the soul is both spiritual and immortal. Even pagan philosophers such as 
        Aristotle and Plato came to that conclusion in their research. Likewise, our Catholic faith reveals that the human soul is spiritual 
        and immortal, but these truths can be understood beyond a faith perspective and from human reason, said Father Auro.</p>

        <p>Anything that is living has a soul, because a soul is the principle of life and activity of natural substances, he said. For example, a tomato 
        has what Aristotle would call a vegetative soul, and a dog would have an animal soul, which is responsible for the unity of the 
        substance and all of its operations.</p><p>What’s different about humans, though, is that we have a rational soul, said Father Auro. 
        “It is only the rational soul that is spiritual and immortal,” he said. St. Thomas Aquinas has said that action follows being; 
        therefore, “if we find the substance, or a creature, that is capable of purely spiritual activity, we have to conclude that the 
        creature performing it is also spiritual,” said Father Auro.</p><p>Seeking holiness is not about living our lives well, but about 
        participating in the life of God. Through the sanctifying grace given by God through the sacrament of baptism, humans have the 
        capability of becoming supernatural organisms.</p><p>“That raises the soul from being a merely natural organism to being a 
        supernatural organism that is now capable of doing things that no natural organism can do,” Father Auro said. “We can know and love 
        God.”</p><p>Through baptism, humans also receive the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity, and with it the ability to know 
        God by faith, and loving Him by charity. We also receive infused supernatural moral virtues, the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the 
        indwelling of the Holy Trinity in the soul.</p><p>“The life of holiness is the life of the supernatural organism,” he said. “I am 
        made alive naturally by my soul, but I am made alive supernaturally by my soul infused by grace” at baptism. “We’re merely natural 
        beings until baptism, when we are able to participate in the life of God.”</p>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(94, 185, 3)"><i>The Spirituality ....</i></h2>
        <p>Often the words soul and spirit are used interchangeably. But the Church shows us that there is a difference between the two, 
        explained Auxiliary Bishop Emeritus Robert Hermann.</p><p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church says: “The Church teaches that this 
        distinction does not introduce a duality into the soul. ‘Spirit’ signifies that from creation man is ordered to a supernatural end 
        and that his soul can gratuitously be raised beyond all it deserves to communion with God” .</p>

        <p>“The soul is the body’s connection 
        to created reality,” Bishop Hermann said, and “is related to the material world — its pleasures, its joys, its frustrations. When we 
        get caught up in the attachments of the soul — to pleasurable things (of the world) — that leads us away from the Kingdom.”</p><p>In 
        contrast, the spirit is our inmost, direct connection with the spirit of God. When we develop that connection with God, most notably 
        through our prayerful relationship with Him, “then the Holy Spirit comes into our soul,” Bishop Hermann said.</p><p>The Holy Spirit 
        separates us from the physical pleasures of our earthy lives, and from the attachments to anger, resentment, bitterness and 
        unforgiveness, as well as our unhealthy attachments to others.</p><p>“The Holy Spirit purifies us, and that’s the painful process that 
        we go through our entire life,” Bishop Hermann said.Purgatory purifies us from all the earthly attachments that we have not given up to
        the Holy Spirit before we die, Bishop Hermann said. It completes the work of purification needed to move to God’s heavenly kingdom.</p>
