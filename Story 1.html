        <p> The Mind is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, 
        yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.</p><p>The mind that thinks our thoughts is a pretty special place.But 
        is it distinct from the brain? Is there, in fact, a soul directing our thoughts or are they determined entirely by the output of
        our biology? Could that mouse scampering through your garden be thinking deep thoughts, or are humans reallyspecial?</p><p>Before 
        there was cognitive science, before there was neurobiology -- before there was even biology -- humanists have wrestled with these 
        questions. Traditionally, philosophy of mind scholars in the West have fallen on one side or the otherof the mind/body question.
        Dualists would say that the mind would function just as it does whether or not it has a body. Dualists say that there is 
        something special about the mind – it’s not just an incredibly interesting and complicated machine. Trees and tables and billiard 
        balls can be explained by physics and biology, but you need to add something extra, some non-physical property, to explain human 
        consciousness.</p><br>
        <h2 style="color:dodgerblue;"><i>The Conscious Mind .... </i></h2>
        <p>The first level of consciousness is referred to as the conscious state, and it refers to our present awareness as you read this. 
        When we receive information from our senses, analyse it, and then make decisions based on that information, we are utilising our 
        conscious mind.</p><p>For instance, you may be conscious of the information you’re reading, the sound of the music you’re listening 
        to, or the content of a conversation you’re having at the moment. All of the thoughts that pass through your mind, all of the 
        sensations and perceptions from the outside world, and all of the memories that you bring into awareness are all a part of that 
        conscious experience.</p><p>The conscious mind comprises everything that we are aware of at any given moment. It encompasses 
        everything we’re thinking about right now, whether it’s in the forefront or the back of our minds. If we are conscious of it, it is 
        in our conscious mind.</p><br>
        <h2 style="color: dodgerblue;"><i>The SubConscious Mind .... </i></h2>
        <p>The subconscious level of consciousness is where dreams are created. We can think of it as a repository for all recalled 
        experiences, the impressions these experiences leave on the mind, and the tendencies that are awoken or reinforced by these 
        impressions.</p><p>Every experience, thought, and impression you’ve ever had is stored in your subconscious mind and has a far greater
        influence on our thought and behaviour patterns than we realise.</p><p>The subconscious stores information just beneath the level of 
        conscious awareness. Individuals can retrieve such information relatively easily, and these are commonly referred to as memories.</p><p>
        Suppose someone were to ask you right now what your middle name was, you would recall it, as well as your father’s birthday and the last 
        time it rained. Past experiences are stored in what Freud referred to as the subconscious part of our minds, which we may be unaware of 
        at one point and then completely focused on at another.</p><p>Our success in life, work, and relationships is frequently determined by 
        the habits we develop over time. Setting priorities and completing critical day-to-day tasks requires both mental and physical strength. 
        As such, this habit is amenable to learning through practise and repetition until it becomes ingrained in our subconscious mind and 
        becomes an indelible part of our behaviour.</p>

        <h2 style="color:dodgerblue;"><i>The UnConscious Mind .... </i></h2>
        <p>The unconscious is the final level of consciousness. This is composed of thoughts, memories, and primitive/instinctual desires that 
        are deeply buried within us, well below our conscious awareness. While we are unaware of their existence, they have a sizable impact on
        our behaviour.While our behaviours frequently reveal the unconscious forces that motivate them, we are unable to readily access the 
        information stored in the unconscious mind. Throughout our childhood, we accumulated a variety of memories and experiences that shaped
        our current beliefs, fears, and insecurities. However, we are unable to recall the majority of these memories. They are unseen forces 
        that influence our behaviour.</p><p>Things that may be forgotten in your unconscious mind include negative past experiences or a 
        traumatic event that you pushed out of your subconscious. Certain life experiences or thoughts may be too frightening for some 
        individuals to fully acknowledge and are thus mediated by the subconscious mind.</p><p>The conscious mind’s contents are all of the 
        things of which you are actively aware. The closely related preconscious mind contains all of the possibilities for bringing something 
        into conscious awareness. Additionally, the preconscious acts as a gatekeeper, limiting the amount of information that enters conscious 
        awareness. </p>
