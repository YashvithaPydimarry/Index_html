        <p>The heart has been considered the source of emotion, courage and wisdom for centuries. For more than 32 years, the HeartMath
        Institute Research Center has explored the physiological mechanisms by which the heart and brain communicate and how the activity 
        of the heart influences our perceptions, emotions, intuition and health. </p><p>Consistently, however, it was heart rate 
        variability, or heart rhythms that stood out as the most dynamic and reflective indicator of one’s emotional states and, therefore,
        current stress and cognitive processes. It became clear that stressful or depleting emotions such as frustration and overwhelm 
        lead to increased disorder in the higher-level brain centers and autonomic nervous system and which are reflected in the heart
        rhythms and adversely affects the functioning of virtually all bodily systems. This eventually led to a much deeper understanding
        of the neural and other communication pathways between the heart and brain. We also observed that the heart acted as though it 
        had a mind of its own and could significantly influence the way we perceive and respond in our daily interactions. In essence, 
        it appeared that the heart could affect our awareness, perceptions and intelligence. </p><p>Researches indicate the heart is far
        more than a simple pump. The heart is, in fact, a highly complex information-processing center with its own functional brain, 
        commonly called the heart brain, that communicates with and influences the cranial brain via the nervous system, hormonal system
        and other pathways. These influences affect brain function and most of the body’s major organs and play an important role in 
        mental and emotional experience and the quality of our lives.</p><p>The discussion then expands from physiological coherence to
        coherence in the context of families, workplaces and communities. Science of the Heart concludes with the perspective that being
        responsible for and increasing our personal coherence not only improves personal health and happiness, but also feeds into and
        influences a global field environment.</p><p>The heart communicates with the brain and body in four ways:</p>
        <dd>•	Neurological communication (nervous system)</dd>
        <dd>•	Biochemical communication (hormones)</dd>
        <dd>•	Biophysical communication (pulse wave)</dd>
        <dd>•	Energetic communication (electromagnetic fields)</dd>

        <p>You’ve probably heard about chakras, the seven wheels of energy in the body that start at the crown of your head, and travel
        down the body to the base of your spine. The fourth chakra, called anahata, is located at the heart. If it becomes gummed up or
        blocked, you may find it hard to develop and keep healthy relationships. It is the fourth primary chakra and serves as our center
        of love for oneself and others, compassion, empathy and forgiveness. The anahata chakra is associated with unconditional love, 
        compassion, and joy. It is the source of deep and profound truths that cannot be expressed in words. </p><p>Anahata is associated
        with the element air, says Snyder.  Air disperses and integrates spiritual understanding of love, compassion, and connection to 
        everything you encounter. Air, like love, is within and all around us. We can embody this element by keeping our heart center 
        open and our love free-flowing.</p><p>When the heart chakra is in healthy alignment you will feel surrounded by love, compassion,
        and joy and connected to the world around you. You will feel open to all experiences in life, and it will feel like challenges, 
        especially in relationships, flow through you and are resolved with ease. An open heart chakra allows us to see all of the beauty
        and love around us, and truly connect to ourselves, our loved ones, and the natural world. This chakra also helps direct love 
        back to ourselves to truly be able to love and accept ourselves and our bodies.</p><p>How to balance the heart chakra
        Though the heart chakra can become blocked, it can be brought back to balance through some of these simple tips.</p>
        <dd>•	Feel gratitude. Keep a gratitude journal, writing down three things a day that you feel grateful for.</dd>
        <dd>•	Practice backbends of any sort. Start with the simple and subtle poses in the yoga . </dd>
        <dd>•	Take part in a loving kindness meditation . </dd>
        <dd>•	Drink heart opening beverages like rose tea and cacao .</dd>
        <p>Healthy and balanced chakra energy is vital for our mental and physical well-being. Our hear center relies on an open anahata
        charka for free-flowing love, compassion, and empathy. When you feel stuck in these areas, you can balance this energy center 
        with simple tools to open your heart to the love and beauty always surrounding us.</p>
