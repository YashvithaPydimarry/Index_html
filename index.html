    <p>Once there was a little and innocent girl named Sunaina who lived in Uttarakhand’s hilly village named Kumati. Her village was very clean and beautiful- full of greenery. Pine trees surrounded the Kumati village and the people in this village lived in a pollution-free environment. All the pets were loved by their owners and were treated kindly. In the morning birds came to everyone’s house to eat food.
    Sunaina loved the nature of the village and always dreamt about mother nature- as a beautiful divine woman. Sunaina always wanted to become as good and beautiful as Mother nature. One day Sunaina topped her class 10th examination and was sent to the country’s capital town Delhi for continuing her studies. After arriving in Delhi, Sunaina noticed that the city is very different from her little village. There were no big trees, no green plants, no flowing rivers, and so birds chirped in the trees and houses. Even the people of Delhi didn’t feed birds.</p>
    <p>Sunaina’s school in Delhi is very beautiful and big. She was staying in a hostel. On the day of her school, she was very much excited about her new classmates and teachers. She spent the whole day happily but was very tired and went to sleep as soon as she reached her hostel room. She again saw Mother nature in her dream but this time Mother nature was very different. She was dirty- her dress was torn with uncombed hair, and her nails were untrimmed- as if she was an evil witch. After this dream, Sunaina was very upset and started crying.</body></html></p>
    The very next day, Sunaina kept thinking about the horrible look of Mother nature and forgetting that dream she painted Mother nature beautifully and put on ornaments in her painting to make her more beautiful. But the next night, Sunaina again dreamed about Mother nature in her sleep. This time she was uglier- looking very ill and devastated. In her dream, Mother nature told Sunaina that her actual ornaments are birds, rivers, trees, flowers, clouds, and butterflies.
    The next day, Sunaina was determined to make mother nature more beautiful by planting trees as this is her real ornament. She told her friends and teachers her idea to plant trees in her school grounds and everyone appreciated her initiatives. She formed an eco club with the help of her teachers and the club was determined to make the school campus pollution-free. They planted trees after their classes on the school grounds.
    After some months of continuing her planting initiative, the school campus was filled with greeneries. One day Sunaina again saw Mother nature and this time she was looking more beautiful than she ever looked. The dream made Sunaina very happy.</p>
